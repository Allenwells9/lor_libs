# Libraries for addons written by Lorand

These contain functions that I use frequently in multiple addons that I have
written.  Rather than continuously duplicating functions and potentially having
them be slightly different in each location, I have put them all together here.

## Installation:

Create a folder called 'lor' in .../Windower/addons/libs/

I.e., place these files in .../Windower/addons/libs/lor/
